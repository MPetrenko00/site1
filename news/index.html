    <h1 class="title">Rock</h1>
    <p>It originated from African-American music such as jazz, rhythm and blues, boogie woogie, gospel, jump blues, as well as country music.
    While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.</p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p class="notebox">Chuck Berry invented rock and roll in 1955. He was a black man playing black music. 
    But times had changed: white kids were listening to rhythm and blues throughout the Northeast,
    and white musicians were playing rhythm and blues side to side with country music.</p>
    
    <p class="notebox">The volume of listening to music affects the brain, so rock music that sounds quiet has a better effect on a person.
    And if you listen to it very loudly, then this will only increase emotional tension and anxiety, 
     and also to some extent will suppress the intellectual abilities of a person.</p>
